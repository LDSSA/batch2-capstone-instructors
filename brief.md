## Predicting vehicle crash survival

In this dataset, you are given a set of features that are known about a scenario for a particular person in the moments
before a car crash occurs. Imagine that you are watching a video of a car crash and you pause it a few seconds before
the crash actually occurs and your job is to look at all people in the immediate vicinity and predict which of them will
survive by extracting the features found in `X_train`

This is a very difficult predicition task using only data so don't expect your scores to be super high.
